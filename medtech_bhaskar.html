    <!-- Application Structure Plan: Designed a 4-tab SPA ('Overview', 'Project Explorer', 'Deep Dives', 'Conclusion'). This structure de-linearizes the report, allowing users to choose their exploration path. The 'Project Explorer' (Tab 2) uses interactive filters and a summary chart for quick browsing of all 20 projects. The 'Deep Dives' tab (Tab 3) uses an accordion to present detailed project info clearly. This task-oriented design is more usable than a long scrolling document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Report Info: 20 projects across 5 categories. Goal: Summarize project distribution. Viz/Method: Doughnut Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: None (static summary). Justification: Provides a quick visual summary of the report's project portfolio, breaking up the text-heavy 'Explorer' page.
        2. Report Info: 20 project list. Goal: Organize/Filter. Viz/Method: Interactive HTML Cards. Interaction: JS-based category filtering. Justification: Allows users to easily find projects of interest and see all projects in a given theme.
        3. Report Info: 6 detailed project deep-dives. Goal: Organize/Inform. Viz/Method: HTML Accordion. Interaction: JS-based expand/collapse. Justification: Manages information density, allowing users to focus on one detailed project at a time without clutter.

                        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">This report outlines 20 high-impact medical technology projects designed to be pursued under the umbrella of the MAHA MedTech Mission. The projects are strategically curated to lie at the precise intersection of the Mission's national objectives (e.g., reducing 70-80% import dependency, focusing on AI, robotics, and implants) and the specific, proven expertise of Dr. Bhaskar Borgohain.</p>
                        <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">Dr. Borgohain's profile as an academic leader, a high-volume surgeon, and a successful R&D collaborator makes him a pivotal figure for translating the Mission's vision into tangible, indigenously-developed ("Atmanirbhar") solutions. The projects are grouped into five strategic categories reflecting this synergy.</p>
